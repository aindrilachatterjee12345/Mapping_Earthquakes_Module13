# Mapping_Earthquakes_Module13
module 13 challenge 
# Purpose:

The purpose of this project was to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days, as well as the tectonic plates around the globe.

# Execution:

To complete this project, we used a GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieved geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. We then add the data to a map, including various different map styles. We also allow the user to toggle the earthquake markers or tectonic plate lines on-and-off.

# Examples:

When you load the page, it defaults to the Streets view with both the Earthquakes and Tectonic Plate overlays engaged.
